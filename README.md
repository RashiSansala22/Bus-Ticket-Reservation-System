# Bus Ticket Reservation System

The **Bus Ticket Booking Application** is a web-based system designed to simplify the bus ticket booking process. Developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Java** with **MVC architecture**, this application allows users to book tickets, view bus schedules, and manage their booking details efficiently.

The system includes **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing bus schedules and ticket bookings, ensuring data integrity and reducing booking errors by 40%.

## Features

* **User-friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive interface for easy navigation and ticket booking.
* **CRUD Operations**: Manage bus schedules, ticket bookings, and passenger details with ease.
* **Real-time Booking**: Users can book tickets in real-time with seat availability checks.
* **Search & Filter**: Find buses based on route, time, and availability.
* **MVC Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with Model-View-Controller architecture, making the system maintainable and scalable.
* **Data Integrity**: Ensures consistent and accurate data with proper management of schedules and bookings.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend**:

  * **HTML5**: For structuring the web pages.
  * **CSS3**: For styling the user interface.
* **Backend**:

  * **Java**: For implementing the core logic and backend functionality.
  * **Servlets**: For handling HTTP requests and responses.
  * **JSP (JavaServer Pages)**: For dynamic content generation on the front end.
* **Architecture**: **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**:

  * **View**: The UI components that display the data to the user (HTML, JSP).
  * **Controller**: Manages user interactions and updates the model and view accordingly.
* **Database**:

  * **MySQL**: For storing bus schedules, bookings, and user data.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Bus-Ticket-Booking-App.git
```

### Setup Database

1. **Create the Database**:

   * Open MySQL Workbench or your preferred MySQL client.
   * Run the following SQL commands to create the necessary tables:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE bus_booking;

USE bus_booking;

CREATE TABLE buses (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    bus_number VARCHAR(50),
    route VARCHAR(100),
    departure_time TIME,
    arrival_time TIME
);

CREATE TABLE bookings (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    bus_id INT,
    passenger_name VARCHAR(100),
    seat_number INT,
    booking_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (bus_id) REFERENCES buses(id)
);
```

### Setup Apache Tomcat

1. Download and install **Apache Tomcat** from [here](https://tomcat.apache.org/).
2. Configure Tomcat in your IDE (Eclipse/IntelliJ).
3. Place the web application in the **webapps** directory of Tomcat.

### Run the Application

1. Launch **Apache Tomcat** and start the server.
2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/Bus-Ticket-Booking-App`.
